# 🧠 Kaggle Generative AI Code Labs

This repository contains hands-on code labs from the [Kaggle 5-Day Generative AI Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-genai). These labs explore key capabilities of Google’s Gemini models and demonstrate how to apply them to real-world use cases like structured generation, few-shot prompting, embeddings, RAG, agents, and custom fine-tuning.

Each notebook is self-contained and follows a well-documented, interactive style — making it easy to learn by doing.
