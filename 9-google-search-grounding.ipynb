Using search grounding is similar to using the RAG system you implemented earlier in the week, but the Gemini API automates a lot of it for you. The model generates Google Search queries and invokes the searches automatically, retrieving relevant data from Google's index of the web and providing links to search suggestions that support the query, so your users can verify the sources.\n\n## New in Gemini 2.0\n\nGemini 2.0 Flash provides a generous Google Search quota as part of the [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing). If you switch models back to 1.5, you will need to [enable billing](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) to use Grounding with Google Search, or you can [try it out in AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/). See the [earlier versions of this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-4-google-search-grounding?scriptVersionId=207458162) for guidance. ","metadata":{"id":"q-mcOl0JY8Xg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Optional: Use Google AI Studio\n\nIf you wish to try out grounding with Google Search, follow this section to try it out using the AI Studio interface. Or skip ahead to the `API` section to try the feature here in your notebook.\n\n### Open AI Studio\n\nStart by going to [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat). You should be in the \"New chat\" interface.\n\nSearch Grounding is best with `gemini-2.0-flash`, but try out `gemini-1.5-flash` too.\n\n![New chat in AI Studio](https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/kaggle/ais-newchat.png)\n\n### Ask a question\n\nNow enter a prompt into the chat interface. Try asking something that is timely and might require recent information to answer, like a recent sport score. For this query, grounding will be **disabled** by default.\n\nThis screenshow shows the response for `What were the top halloween costumes this year?`. Every execution will be different but typically the model talks about 2023, and hedges its responses saying it doesn't have access to specific information resulting in a general comment, rather than specific answers.\n\n![Sample question-answer pair without grounding](https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/kaggle/cricket-ungrounded.png)\n\n### Enable grounding\n\nOn the right-hand sidebar, under the `Tools` section. Find and enable the `Grounding` option.\n\n![Enable grounding button](https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/kaggle/enable-grounding.png)\n\nNow re-run your question by hovering over the user prompt in the chat history, and pressing the Gemini âœ¨ icon to re-run your prompt.\n\n![Re-run prompt button](https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/kaggle/re-run-button.png)\n\nYou should now see a response generated that references sources from Google Search.\n\n![Response with grounded sources from Google!](https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/kaggle/cricket-grounded.png)\n\n\n### Try your own queries\n\nExplore this interface and try some other queries. Share what works well in the [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1101210829807956100/1303438361117069363)! You can start from [this blank template](https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts/1FZtxKLFZIJ1p_0rICu8K2CNIF1tkAnf4) that has search grounding enabled.\n\nThe remaining steps require an API key with billing enabled. They are not required to complete this course; if you have tried grounding in AI Studio you are done for this notebook.","metadata":{},"attachments":{"eb616808-a885-4b3a-b836-957cbb4761e3.png":{"image/png":"wAAAAAAAAAAAAAUEUKvAAAAAAAAAAAAABQRQq8AAAAAAAAAAAAAFBFDbUOAAAAAADAzlm0aFHuuOOONDU1ZfXq1XnrrbfSs2fPDBgwIIcffnhOPvnknHjiiWlsbKx1VAAAAAAAkhRlWZa1DgEAAAAAwI6777778t3vfjdPPfXUh87ut99+ufzyyzNp0qQqJAMAAAAA4H9R4AUAAAAA+JhpaWnJ9OnTc+2117Z9bdCgQTnxxBNzyCGHpHfv3nnjjTeyZs2aLFy4MCtXrmybmzJlSq6//vo0NOzeL2ibMWNGfvzjHydJXn/99fTu3bu2gQAAAAAA3uf/Acv6qWyHuQeEAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC","text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Image object>"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"----"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"The chart displays the medal distribution (Gold, Silver, and Bronze) for the top 10 countries at the 2024 Olympics.
